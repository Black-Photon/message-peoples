Developing:
I run using IntelliJ. There is one function running the main program. You can choose the respective option from there.

Formatting:
To keep consistency, please use the following format in files:
    
<!-- language: lang-java -->
    
    //VARIABLES --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    //Var Type 1
    private int randomVar;
    public String thisVar;
    
    //Var Type 2
    public int otherVar;
    
    
    
 	//METHODS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 	
 	//Constuctor
 	thisClass(){}
 	
 	//Method Type 2
 	@Override protected void life(){}
 	/**
 	 * Documentation
 	 */
 	@FXML public String anotherMethod(){}
 	public void method();

Note the 3 lines above the METHODS line. You may exclude certain parts in files with small enough sections, or use differently if you feel it's necessary.
The point of this is to make things EASIER later on. If it becomes too difficult, you may use less, or make slight alterations

This project is in the process of making a messaging application easy to use. Any ideas whatsoever are helpful

This project is essentially done for now, but any ideas are welcome. I'll be integrating to work with jOSeph soon, but don't assume compatibility until version 4.2 jOSeph.

If you must get in touch for some other reason, my E-Mail is joseph_keane@live.co.uk. Try a subject making it clearly not spam
